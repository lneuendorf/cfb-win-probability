        seconds_remaining (int): Seconds remaining in game.
        down (int): Current down (1 to 4).
        distance (int): Yards needed for a first down.
        yards_to_goal (int): Yards to the end zone from current position.
        temperature (float): Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
        wind_speed (float): Wind speed in miles per hour.
        precipitation (float): Precipitation in inches.
        elevation (float): Elevation in feet above sea level.
        home_division (str): Division of the home team (e.g., "FBS", "FCS").
        home_is_power_five (bool): Whether the home team is a Power Five team.
