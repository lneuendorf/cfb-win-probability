model limitations
- excludes overtime (for the time being), due to the format changes from 2013-2025
- does not account for turnover probability on kickoff or punt
- does not account for blocked punt, kickoff, fg
- does not account for proabiltiy of penalties
    - does account for pentalty yards indirectly in some models (e.g. punt or kickoff return yardline)
- lacking post-snap penalty modeling
- lacking some team specific tendency features (historical onside kick counts, go rates...)
- penalty modeling could use more work. Currently base rates.

metric ideas:
- sharp ration adapted to this context, to capture risk and expected value in one metric.
    football_sharpe = E[WP_after - WP_baseline] / std_dev_WP_after where WP_baseline is the avg eWP across all decisions



#TODO
1. FG Models
    - add fg attempt seconds used
    - add fg block seconds used
    - set clock rolling or not
2. Punt Models
3. Sack Models
4. Run Models
5. Pass Models
6. Time Runoff Logic between plays if rolling
7. handle for game stopages (2 minute warn, half, quarters)
7. Overtime Model
8. Test bench

Potential bugs
- distance is less than YTG (goal to go)
    - e.g. on field goal block return
