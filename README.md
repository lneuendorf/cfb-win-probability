model limitations
- does not account for turnover probability on kickoff or punt
- does not account for blocked punt, kickoff, fg
- does not account for proabiltiy of penalties
    - does account for pentalty yards indirectly in some models (e.g. punt or kickoff return yardline)
- lacking post-snap penalty modeling


Todo
- create tests of each of the model functions to enusre they are returning logical probabilites / values
